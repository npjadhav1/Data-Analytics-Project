🧪 SQL Integration – Backend Validation ( View SQL Query Report )
Used SQL extensively to validate dashboard KPIs, segments, and filters.

SQL was used for:

✅ Data extraction from tables
✅ Loan type, status, and amount aggregation
✅ Cross-checking Power BI visual values
❓ Problem Solved by the Dashboard
"Loan departments often struggle to track performance, identify risky applicants, and monitor repayment trends—especially when data is spread across thousands of loan applications."

This Power BI Dashboard addresses multiple business and data analysis challenges in the banking and loan sector:

🔧 1. Lack of Centralized Insight into Loan Applications
✅ Solution: Aggregates all loan-related KPIs into one interactive view.
📊 Displays total applications, funded and received amounts, and borrower metrics.
🔧 2. Difficulty in Identifying Good vs Bad Loans
✅ Solution: Separates Good Loans (Fully Paid, Current) from Bad Loans (Charged Off).
📉 Enables risk profiling and early identification of default-prone loans.
🔧 3. No Trend Tracking or Monthly Monitoring
✅ Solution: Uses MTD, PMTD, and MoM KPIs to show performance trends.
📆 Helps analyze seasonal patterns and month-to-month changes in loan activity.
🔧 4. Poor Visibility into Regional and Demographic Behavior
✅ Solution: State-wise maps, charts by home ownership, employment length, and purpose.
📍 Identifies high-performing or high-risk demographics and regions.
🔧 5. Limited Ability to Audit or Review Individual Loans
✅ Solution: Detailed page with full record-level data such as Loan ID, Date, Rate, Amount, etc.
🕵️‍♂️ Supports deep dives, filtering, or exporting for external audits.
🔧 6. Gap Between Raw Data and Dashboard Insights
✅ Solution: SQL query logic used to validate and verify backend metrics.
🔒 Ensures data trust, transparency, and accuracy across KPIs.
💡 Business Impact
🎯 Improves strategic decision-making based on real-time insights.
🔍 Helps reduce loan defaults by identifying risky patterns early.
📈 Supports smarter and data-driven lending and recovery policies.
“With this dashboard, data isn't just numbers — it's actionable intelligence.”

📊 Key Insights
✅ 86% of loans are Good Loans

🔁 Fully Paid loans dominate, indicating good recovery

⚠️ Purposes like Debt Consolidation show higher risk

🕒 Long loan terms and state-level data offer segmentation value
